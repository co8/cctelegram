### Authorization Framework

```yaml
Permission Model:

    - Full system access
    - User management
    - Configuration changes
    - Security administration
    
  operator:
    - System monitoring
    - Event management
    - Basic configuration
    - Operational tasks
    
  user:
    - Event notifications
    - Personal configuration
    - Read-only access
    - Limited interactions

  service:
    - API access
    - Automated operations
    - System integrations
    - Resource-limited scope
```

| **Internal** | System logs, metrics, operational data | AES-256 + access controls | 3 years |
| **Confidential** | User data, configuration, credentials | AES-256 + RBAC + audit | 1 year |
