# CC Telegram Bridge - Project Overview

## Purpose
A high-performance, secure Rust-based bridge between Claude Code/VSCode and Telegram for comprehensive development monitoring and interaction. The system provides real-time notifications for development events, interactive messaging, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Key Features
- **44+ Event Types**: Complete coverage of development lifecycle including task management, code operations, file system changes, build processes, git operations, system monitoring, and user interactions
- **Telegram Integration**: Real-time notifications with interactive messaging and approval workflows
- **Security**: Multi-user access control, rate limiting, input validation, audit logging
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus integration, health checks, performance tracking
- **Production Ready**: Robust error handling, flexible configuration, deployment tools

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Rust 1.70+
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio
- **Telegram Bot**: Teloxide framework
- **Serialization**: Serde (JSON)
- **Configuration**: TOML with environment variable overrides
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, warp HTTP server
- **File Watching**: notify crate
- **Logging**: tracing with tracing-subscriber
- **Error Handling**: anyhow and thiserror
- **Security**: ring cryptography, base64 encoding
- **Performance**: sysinfo for system metrics
