# Task Completion Checklist

## Code Quality Validation
Before considering any task complete, run these commands:

### 1. Code Formatting
```bash
cargo fmt --check
# If formatting issues found, run: cargo fmt
```

### 2. Linting
```bash
cargo clippy
# Address any warnings or errors before proceeding
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# For integration testing, ensure application dependencies are available
cargo test integration_tests

# For performance testing
cargo test performance_monitor
```

### 4. Build Verification
```bash
# Ensure clean release build
cargo build --release
```

## Quality Standards
- **Zero clippy warnings** on new/modified code
- **All tests passing** (currently 38 tests)
- **Clean formatting** with cargo fmt
- **No compilation warnings** in release mode

## Documentation Requirements
- Update relevant documentation if API changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update README.md if user-facing changes
- Add entries to CHANGELOG.md for significant changes

## Security Considerations
- No hardcoded secrets or tokens
- Proper input validation for user-facing code
- Rate limiting considerations for new endpoints
- Audit logging for security-relevant changes

## Performance Validation
- Run performance monitoring script for significant changes:
```bash
./performance_monitor.sh monitor
```
- Verify no memory leaks in long-running operations
- Check that new features don't exceed performance thresholds

## Integration Testing
For changes affecting the event system or Telegram integration:
- Test with sample events in `~/.cc_telegram/events/`
- Verify health endpoints still respond correctly
- Check that monitoring metrics are still collected

## Pre-deployment Checklist
```bash
# Complete quality check
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy && cargo test && cargo build --release

# Performance validation
./performance_monitor.sh deployment-check

# Verify configuration still loads correctly
RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/cc-telegram-bridge --help
