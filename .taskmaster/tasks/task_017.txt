# Task ID: 17
# Title: Advanced Error Handling and Resilience Engineering
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling, circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and system resilience features
# Details:
Implement circuit breaker pattern using opossum library for external API calls. Create comprehensive error taxonomy with custom error classes extending Error base class. Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism using p-retry with jitter. Add structured logging using winston with correlation IDs for request tracing. Implement graceful shutdown handling with proper cleanup of resources. Use bull queue for background job processing with Redis backend. Implement health check endpoints following RFC 7807 Problem Details specification. Create monitoring dashboards using Prometheus metrics and Grafana visualization.

# Test Strategy:
Chaos engineering tests using chaos-monkey to simulate failures. Error injection testing for all failure scenarios. Resilience testing with network partitions, API timeouts, and resource exhaustion. Recovery testing to validate graceful degradation and automatic recovery mechanisms.
