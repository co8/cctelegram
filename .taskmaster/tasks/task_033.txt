# Task ID: 33
# Title: Phase 5: Testing & Validation - Comprehensive MCP Command Testing and User Experience Validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 31, 32, 25, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Execute comprehensive testing of /tasks command with MCP server running and in fallback mode, validate removal of /current_task command, and verify all user experience improvements through automated and manual testing.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive testing and validation for Phase 5: 1) MCP Server Active Testing - Create automated test suite using Jest and supertest to validate /tasks command functionality with MCP server running, test all command parameters and response formats, validate connection pooling and retry mechanisms, test concurrent command execution scenarios, and measure response times to ensure <500ms performance targets. 2) Fallback Mode Testing - Implement test scenarios with MCP server stopped/unavailable, validate graceful fallback to direct file system access, test error handling and user feedback during fallback transitions, verify data consistency between MCP and fallback modes, and validate automatic reconnection when server becomes available. 3) Command Removal Validation - Create regression test suite to ensure /current_task command removal doesn't break existing workflows, test all CLI entry points and command parsing logic, validate MCP tool registration and command routing, test backward compatibility with existing user scripts and integrations, and verify help documentation updates. 4) User Experience Testing - Implement UX validation using automated accessibility testing with axe-core, test user journey flows from command invocation to completion, validate error message clarity and actionable guidance using user testing scenarios, measure task completion times and success rates, and implement performance monitoring with real-world usage patterns. 5) Integration Testing - Create end-to-end test scenarios combining all Phase 1-4 improvements, test cross-system integration with CCTelegram bridge and Task Master, validate monitoring and alerting systems under various failure conditions, and test deployment pipeline with blue-green deployment validation.

# Test Strategy:
Execute multi-layered validation approach: Automated testing using Jest with >95% code coverage for MCP command functionality, mock MCP server scenarios for fallback testing, and integration tests with Docker containers simulating production environments. Performance testing using k6 to validate <500ms response times under load with 1000 concurrent requests. User experience testing with Playwright for automated UI/UX validation and manual usability testing with 10+ user scenarios. Regression testing using comprehensive test suite covering all existing functionality to ensure no breaking changes. Chaos engineering tests using failure injection to validate system resilience and recovery mechanisms. End-to-end validation with complete workflow testing from command execution through CCTelegram notifications and Task Master integration. Security testing with authentication and authorization validation for MCP server communication. Documentation testing to ensure all help text, error messages, and user guidance are accurate and actionable.

Build concurrent execution test scenarios using Promise.all() to validate thread safety. Implement performance benchmarks to ensure <500ms response times under load.

## 2. Fallback Mode Testing and Error Handling Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive test scenarios for MCP server unavailability, validating graceful fallback to direct file system access, error handling, data consistency, and automatic reconnection capabilities
### Details:
Create test scenarios with MCP server stopped using Docker containers or process management. Implement fallback mode validation by comparing direct file system results with expected MCP responses. Build error handling tests for various failure modes including network timeouts, server crashes, and connection refused scenarios.
