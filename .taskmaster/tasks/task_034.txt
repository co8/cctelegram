# Task ID: 34
# Title: Phase 1: Critical Message Delivery Fixes - Rate Limiting, Retry Logic, and Batch Processing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17, 19, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive rate limiting for Telegram API compliance (30 msg/sec global, 1 msg/sec per chat), HTTP 429 retry logic with exponential backoff, and fix immediate batch processing on startup to achieve 95%+ message delivery reliability.
# Details:
Implement Telegram API rate limiting using token bucket algorithm with two-tier approach: global rate limiter (30 messages/second) using bottleneck library with Redis backend for distributed rate limiting, and per-chat rate limiter (1 message/second) using Map-based tracking with chat ID keys. Create comprehensive retry mechanism for HTTP 429 errors using p-retry with exponential backoff (initial: 1s, max: 30s, factor: 2) and jitter to prevent thundering herd. Implement proper error categorization distinguishing retryable (429, 502, 503, 504) from non-retryable errors (400, 401, 403). Fix batch processing by implementing startup event queue management using bull queue with Redis, processing accumulated events with proper rate limiting instead of immediate burst sending. Add message delivery tracking with correlation IDs, delivery confirmations, and failure analysis. Implement circuit breaker pattern for Telegram API calls using opossum library to prevent cascade failures. Create monitoring dashboard tracking delivery rates, retry statistics, and rate limit adherence using Prometheus metrics. Add graceful degradation for high-volume scenarios with priority-based message queuing (critical, high, normal, low). Implement dead letter queue for permanently failed messages with manual retry capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite using Jest with Telegram API mock server to validate rate limiting accuracy under load conditions including burst scenarios, sustained high traffic, and mixed chat volumes. Implement integration tests for HTTP 429 retry logic using nock to simulate API responses with various error codes, response delays, and recovery patterns. Test batch processing fixes with simulated startup scenarios containing 1000+ accumulated events, validating proper rate limiting and delivery confirmation. Create load testing suite using k6 to simulate concurrent message sending from multiple chat contexts, validating per-chat rate limiting accuracy and global rate compliance. Implement chaos engineering tests using fault injection to validate circuit breaker behavior, retry exhaustion scenarios, and dead letter queue functionality. Monitor delivery rate improvements using automated testing with baseline measurements comparing current 70% delivery rate against target 95%+ rate. Validate Redis-based rate limiting persistence across service restarts and distributed deployments.

SubAgent Alpha (Rate Limiting Specialist) assigned to implement two-tier rate limiting system with technical focus on global rate limiter (30 msg/sec using bottleneck + Redis) and per-chat rate limiter (1 msg/sec using Map-based tracking) integrated with existing telegram/bot.rs and telegram/messages.rs. Deliverables include Redis backend setup, global rate limiter foundation, per-chat rate limiter with Map tracking, integration with existing message dispatch system, error handling and fallback mechanisms, configuration, comprehensive test suite and performance validation.
