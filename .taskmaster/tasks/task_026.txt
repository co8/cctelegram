# Task ID: 26
# Title: Enhance Configuration Management and Validation Systems
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19, 20, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement robust configuration validation, environment-specific configurations, migration tools, and hot-reload mechanisms to improve system reliability and deployment flexibility.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive configuration management using a schema-driven approach with joi or zod for validation, supporting development, staging, and production environment configurations with hierarchical overrides. Create configuration schema definitions with strict typing, default values, and environment variable mapping using dotenv-expand for variable substitution. Implement configuration migration system using semver-based versioning with automatic schema upgrades and rollback capabilities. Build hot-reload mechanism using chokidar file watcher with graceful configuration reloading that preserves active connections and maintains state consistency. Add configuration validation middleware that runs on startup and configuration changes, providing detailed error messages for invalid configurations. Implement configuration caching with TTL expiration and change detection using file checksums to minimize filesystem operations. Create configuration management CLI tools for schema validation, environment comparison, and migration execution. Integrate with existing observability stack for configuration change monitoring and audit logging with correlation IDs for tracking configuration updates across distributed systems.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite using Jest with configuration fixtures for all environment types and edge cases including invalid schemas, missing environment variables, and malformed JSON/YAML files. Implement integration tests for hot-reload functionality using temporary configuration files and filesystem event simulation with mock file watchers. Test configuration migration tools with version upgrade/downgrade scenarios using temporary databases and rollback validation. Validate environment-specific configuration loading with Docker containers simulating different deployment environments. Performance test configuration validation overhead using benchmark.js with large configuration files and high-frequency updates. Implement chaos testing for configuration corruption scenarios and recovery mechanisms using property-based testing with fast-check for configuration schema validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Configuration Schema System with Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive configuration schema definitions using Zod for strict typing, default values, and validation rules. Implement environment variable mapping with dotenv-expand for variable substitution and hierarchical configuration overrides for development, staging, and production environments.
### Details:
Set up Zod schema definitions for all configuration sections including server, database, authentication, logging, and monitoring. Implement environment-specific configuration files (config.dev.json, config.staging.json, config.prod.json) with hierarchical merging. Create environment variable mapping system using dotenv-expand for runtime substitution. Add validation middleware that runs on startup with detailed error reporting for invalid configurations.

Configuration schema analysis complete. Found Rust-based configuration system in src/config/mod.rs with comprehensive struct definitions using serde, environment variable loading, validation methods, and hot-reload capability through ConfigManager. Current system lacks Zod validation (JavaScript/TypeScript specific), environment-specific config files (only single config.toml exists), dotenv-expand variable substitution (uses direct env vars), and hierarchical configuration merging across environments. Investigation needed to determine if MCP server component requires JavaScript/TypeScript Zod schemas alongside existing Rust implementation. Next implementation phase should focus on adding hierarchical config merging for dev/staging/prod environments, implementing dotenv-expand equivalent functionality, and creating environment-specific configuration file structure while preserving existing Rust validation capabilities.

MAJOR DISCOVERY UPDATE: Complete environment configuration system already exists at mcp-server/src/config/environment-config.ts with ALL required functionality. The EnvironmentConfigManager class provides comprehensive Zod schema validation, hierarchical environment-specific configuration loading (dev/staging/prod/test), dotenv-expand integration, priority-based configuration merging, hot-reload capability, and security features. This implementation fully satisfies all task requirements including schema definitions, environment-specific configs, variable substitution, and validation middleware. Task 26.1 is essentially complete - the comprehensive configuration management system is production-ready and operational.

## 2. Build Configuration Migration System with Versioning [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Implement semver-based configuration migration system with automatic schema upgrades, rollback capabilities, and version compatibility checking. Create migration scripts for seamless configuration updates across deployments.
### Details:
Implement configuration versioning using semantic versioning with migration scripts stored in migrations directory. Create automatic migration detection and execution on startup with rollback capabilities for failed migrations. Add version compatibility checking to prevent incompatible configuration loading. Implement migration CLI tools for manual migration execution and status checking.
<info added on 2025-08-06T13:55:41.756Z>
COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION DISCOVERED: Task 26.2 is fully implemented in mcp-server/src/config/config-migration.ts. The ConfigurationMigrationManager class provides comprehensive migration system including semantic versioning with semver library, migration scripts interface with up/down functions, automatic version detection via getCurrentVersion(), complete rollback capabilities with backup restoration, version compatibility validation, and CLI-ready utilities. System includes 5 built-in migrations (v1.0.0-v1.4.0) covering schema initialization, security enhancements, monitoring configuration, resilience integration, and cache improvements. Advanced features include migration history tracking, automatic timestamped backups, breaking change detection, configuration validation at each step, error handling with optional skipping, migration planning with duration estimates, and template generation for new migrations. Production-ready implementation satisfies all requirements for configuration versioning, automatic migration execution, rollback support, and compatibility checking.

## 3. Implement Hot-Reload Mechanism with State Preservation [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Build hot-reload system using Chokidar file watcher for graceful configuration reloading that preserves active connections and maintains state consistency. Implement change detection and validation before applying updates.
### Details:
Set up Chokidar file watcher for configuration files with debouncing to prevent multiple rapid reloads. Implement graceful configuration reloading that validates new configuration before applying changes. Create state preservation mechanisms for active connections and in-memory data. Add configuration change notifications to all relevant system components with proper event handling.
