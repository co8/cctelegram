Rate limiting implementation is excellent using rate-limiter-flexible library (100 requests/60 seconds) with proper configuration via environment variables MCP_RATE_LIMIT_POINTS and MCP_RATE_LIMIT_DURATION. Memory-based rate limiting includes proper error handling and bypass detection for missing clientId context.\n\nCritical security gaps identified in HTTP communications: health endpoint (localhost:8080/health) and metrics endpoint (localhost:8080/metrics) operate without TLS encryption. Axios client configured with 5000ms timeout for health checks. Bridge status caching implemented (30 second duration) to reduce health check load.\n\n**SECURITY VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED:**\n- HIGH RISK: Missing TLS encryption for internal communications (CVSS 7.4) - all internal traffic transmitted unencrypted\n- MEDIUM RISK: Absent HTTP security headers (CVSS 5.3) - missing HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options defense-in-depth protections  \n- LOW RISK: Network DoS vulnerabilities (CVSS 3.1) - basic rate limiting provides minimal protection\n\n**POSITIVE SECURITY CONTROLS:**\n- Localhost-only binding provides good network isolation\n- Configurable health port via CC_TELEGRAM_HEALTH_PORT environment variable\n- Request timeouts prevent hanging connections\n- Rate limiting prevents basic abuse scenarios\n\n**PRIORITY REMEDIATION REQUIRED:**\nP1: Implement HTTPS/TLS for all internal communications\nP2: Add comprehensive HTTP security headers for web interfaces\nP3: Implement network-level monitoring and alerting systems\nP4: Add connection rate limiting and request size limits\n\nNetwork attack surface analysis complete.
