Rate limiting implementation is excellent using rate-limiter-flexible library (100 requests/60 seconds) with proper configuration via environment variables MCP_RATE_LIMIT_POINTS and MCP_RATE_LIMIT_DURATION. Memory-based rate limiting includes proper error handling and bypass detection for missing clientId context.\n\nCritical security gaps identified in HTTP communications: health endpoint (localhost:8080/health) and metrics endpoint (localhost:8080/metrics) operate without TLS encryption. Axios client configured with 5000ms timeout for health checks. Bridge status caching implemented (30 second duration) to reduce health check load.\n\n**SECURITY VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED:**\n- HIGH RISK: Missing TLS encryption for internal communications (CVSS 7.4) - all internal traffic transmitted unencrypted\n- MEDIUM RISK: Absent HTTP security headers (CVSS 5.3) - missing HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options defense-in-depth protections  \n- LOW RISK: Network DoS vulnerabilities (CVSS 3.1) - basic rate limiting provides minimal protection\n\n**POSITIVE SECURITY CONTROLS:**\n- Localhost-only binding provides good network isolation\n- Configurable health port via CC_TELEGRAM_HEALTH_PORT environment variable\n- Request timeouts prevent hanging connections\n- Rate limiting prevents basic abuse scenarios\n\n**PRIORITY REMEDIATION REQUIRED:**\nP1: Implement HTTPS/TLS for all internal communications\nP2: Add comprehensive HTTP security headers for web interfaces\nP3: Implement network-level monitoring and alerting systems\nP4: Add connection rate limiting and request size limits\n\nNetwork attack surface analysis complete.

The error pattern follows the mathematical formula: 10 operations with every 3rd operation flagged as error equals 3.33/10 = 33.3%, matching our observed 35.7% error rate.

Telegram Bot Entry Point (src/telegram/bot.rs)\n- `handle_message()` processes incoming Telegram commands (lines 225-346)\n- **CRITICAL FINDING**: `/tasks` and `/current_task` are identical (lines 264-277)\n  - Both call the same method: `self.get_tasks_status().await`\n  - Redundant code causing confusion for users\n\n### 2. Task Status Retrieval Chain (src/telegram/bot.rs:564-659)\n- `get_tasks_status()` orchestrates the entire data pipeline:\n  1. Checks MCP server status via `check_mcp_server_status()` (HTTP health endpoint)\n  2. If healthy → calls `query_mcp_tasks()` (HTTP request to MCP server)\n  3. If unhealthy → falls back to direct TaskMaster file reading\n\n### 3. MCP Server Bridge Client (mcp-server/src/bridge-client.ts)\n- **KEY BOTTLENECK**: `getTaskStatus()` method (lines 1055-1214) is the core data processor\n- Performs extensive file system operations:\n  - Multiple path existence checks (Claude Code todos)\n  - JSON file reading and parsing\n  - Complex filtering and summarization logic\n  - Batch file operations for optimization\n\n### 4. Performance Bottleneck Analysis\n\n#### Primary Bottlenecks:\n1. **HTTP Round Trips**: Telegram Bot → MCP Server (2 HTTP calls per command)\n   - Health check call first\n   - Task status call second\n   \n2. **File System Operations in MCP Server**:\n   - Searches 3+ paths for Claude Code todos: `.claude/todos.json`, `~/.claude/todos.json`, `.cc_todos.json`\n   - Reads and parses TaskMaster `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`\n   - No caching mechanism for frequently accessed data\n   \n3. **Data Processing Overhead**:\n   - JSON parsing and filtering on every request\n   - Complex status summarization calculations\n   - Redundant processing for identical commands\n\n#### Secondary Issues:\n1. **Health Check Logic Bug**: Lines 662-676 only check HTTP status, not JSON response body\n2. **Error Injection Pollution**: Test code in `src/benchmark/benchmark-suite.ts:439` contaminating production metrics\n3. **Redundant Command Implementation**: Duplicate code paths for `/tasks` and `/current_task`\n\n### 5. Architecture Strengths\n- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when MCP server unavailable\n- **File System Optimization**: Uses batch operations with `getFsOptimizer()`\n- **Security**: Input validation and sanitization throughout\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error propagation with structured logging\n\n### 6. Identified Solutions\n1. **Remove redundant `/current_task` command**\n2. **Implement response caching** in MCP server (5-minute TTL)\n3. **Fix health check parsing** to read JSON response body\n4. **Clean up test pollution** in metrics collection\n5. **Add connection pooling** for HTTP requests\n</info added on 2025-08-06T11:49:15.964Z>",

The user is providing final audit results that supersede the initial completion note from 2025-08-06. The new count of 375 errors (up from 97) suggests a more thorough analysis was completed.\n\nFINAL AUDIT COMPLETION - Comprehensive TypeScript error analysis updated with complete project scan revealing 375 total TypeScript compilation errors (revised from initial 97 count). Updated error categorization: P0 Critical (219 errors) - null safety violations (93 TS18048/TS2532), type assignment mismatches (107 TS2345/TS2322), module resolution failures (19 TS2307) blocking compilation. P1 High (53 errors) - property initialization, missing exports with system impact. P2 Medium (103 errors) - feature functionality, development experience. Module impact analysis identifies resilience module (129 errors), observability module (119 errors), and config module (36 errors) as most critical. Deliverables generated: typescript-error-audit-report.md with complete analysis, priority matrix with P0/P1/P2 framework, dependency impact mapping, and specialist assignment strategy. Strategic phased approach confirmed: Phase 1 P0 resolution for compilation enablement, Phase 2 system stability, Phase 3 feature integration.

Resolve any missing peer dependencies for `@playwright/test` and its ecosystem. Update the `playwright.config.ts` to be fully ESM compatible. Implement the `webServer` option to automatically launch and manage the lifecycle of the MCP server and CCTelegram bridge during test runs, ensuring a clean environment for each execution. Configure it with the correct startup command, a health check URL to poll, and an appropriate timeout.\n3. **Test Refactoring and Resilience:** Systematically review and fix failing tests.

Ensure all custom test helper utilities are refactored for ESM compatibility and are properly imported. \n4. **Enhanced Debugging and CI Setup:** Enable and configure Playwright's `trace` option in `playwright.config.ts` to `on-first-retry`.
