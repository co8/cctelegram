For example, \"Switched to native mode\" must be changed to \"Switched to local mode\".\n6.  **Documentation Update:**\n    *   Thoroughly update all project documentation (README.md, API docs, user guides, developer setup instructions) to reflect the command rename and terminology change.\n    *   Ensure all code examples and command lists are corrected.",
