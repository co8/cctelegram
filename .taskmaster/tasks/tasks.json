The MarkdownV2 escape function was missing bullet points and backslash characters, causing message formatting to break. Updated both messages.rs and bot.rs escape functions to handle bullet points (•, ◦, ▪, ▫, ‣, ⁃) and backslash escaping.

The enum implementation includes proper serde serialization support, human-readable display names, and validation methods meeting all functional requirements.\n\nReady for reliability enhancements: implementing event deduplication using UUID-based event_id system, adding retry tracking for failed deliveries, implementing queue management metadata for delivery status tracking, and adding correlation IDs for request-response pairing to achieve zero message loss reliability target.\n</info added on 2025-08-04T17:19:55.007Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-04T17:24:28.282Z>\nTask 2.1 has been successfully completed with full implementation of the core event type system including enterprise-grade reliability enhancements. All event types (38+ variants) are properly defined with ProcessingStatus enum, UUID-based deduplication, correlation tracking, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive state management.

Include optional fields for attachments, tags, and custom metadata. Use #[serde(flatten)] for composition patterns.\n<info added on 2025-08-04T17:26:05.479Z>\nCurrent implementation review reveals a unified EventData approach with optional fields rather than specialized structs. The existing design provides flexibility and JSON compatibility but may sacrifice type safety. Trade-off analysis indicates three potential paths: enhancing current unified approach, refactoring to specialized structs with composition, or implementing a hybrid solution. Current EventData structure covers all required fields but lacks compile-time guarantees for event-specific field requirements. Specialized structs would provide better type safety and clearer API contracts but increase complexity and potential serialization challenges. Hybrid approach could offer both flexibility and safety through type-safe wrappers around base EventData. Implementation complexity increases with specialization but may provide better long-term maintainability and developer experience.\n</info added on 2025-08-04T17:26:05.479Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-04T17:27:42.311Z>\n**COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION**: Successfully designed and implemented hybrid event data structures and schemas combining unified EventData approach with specialized TypedEvent structures. Delivered 8 specialized data structures (TaskCompletionData, ApprovalRequestData, ProgressUpdateData, PerformanceAlertData, CodeOperationData, BuildTestData, GitOperationData, SystemMonitoringData) with comprehensive SystemMetrics structure for performance tracking. Implemented TypedEvent wrapper providing type-safe event container with tagged union serialization, complete builder API with 8+ type-safe methods, and composition patterns using #[serde(flatten)] for seamless JSON handling. Maintained backward compatibility through from_legacy_event() and to_legacy_event() methods while providing compile-time guarantees for event-specific field requirements. Architecture delivers enhanced developer experience with IDE autocompletion, reduced runtime errors through type system enforcement, and clear API contracts. Code compiles successfully with zero errors, includes comprehensive documentation, and maintains consistent patterns ready for production integration. Hybrid solution provides optimal balance between flexibility (unified EventData) and safety (specialized TypedEvent structures).\n</info added on 2025-08-04T17:27:42.311Z>",
