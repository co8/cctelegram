# Task ID: 20
# Title: Production Monitoring and Observability Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and observability stack for production environment
# Details:
Implement observability stack using OpenTelemetry with Jaeger for distributed tracing and Prometheus for metrics collection. Create comprehensive monitoring dashboards using Grafana with SLA/SLO tracking. Implement log aggregation using ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or modern alternatives like Loki. Set up alerting using PagerDuty or similar with escalation policies. Implement APM (Application Performance Monitoring) with New Relic or Datadog integration. Create custom metrics for business KPIs including notification delivery rates, response times, and error rates. Use Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment with monitoring stack integration.

# Test Strategy:
Monitoring validation with synthetic transaction testing. Alert testing with controlled failure injection. Dashboard testing with historical data replay. SLA/SLO validation with real-world traffic patterns. Observability stack performance testing to ensure minimal overhead on application performance.
