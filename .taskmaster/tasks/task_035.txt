# Title: Phase 2: Message Queue Implementation - Activate Message Queue System and Implement File Debouncing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 34, 17, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Activate the existing message queue system using queue.rs module and implement file debouncing with 500ms debounce window to improve message delivery rate to 98%+ through proper queue management and event batching using Rust technologies.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive message queue activation and file debouncing system using Rust: 1) Queue System Activation - Activate queue.rs module by integrating Redis-backed message queue using redis-rs with custom priority queue implementation or tokio-cron-scheduler, implement queue processing with configurable concurrency (default: 5 workers) using tokio task spawning, add custom monitoring dashboard or metrics collection for real-time queue status and job management, implement dead letter queue for failed messages with exponential backoff retry (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s) using tokio::time, and create queue persistence using Redis AOF for durability. 2) File Debouncing Implementation - Implement file event debouncing using notify crate for file watching with custom 500ms debounce window using tokio::time::sleep and tokio channels, batch file events within debounce window to reduce duplicate processing, implement file content hashing using sha2 crate with SHA256 to detect actual file changes vs timestamp updates, and add file event queue using tokio channels to handle batched file changes. 3) Queue Integration - Connect file debouncing system to message queue using standardized job format with serde serialization, implement queue job types (telegram_message, file_event, batch_process) with appropriate priority levels, add queue metrics collection including processing time, success rate, and failure count, implement circuit breaker pattern for queue processing using failsafe crate or custom implementation, and create queue health monitoring with automated failover using tokio supervision. 4) Performance Optimization - Implement message deduplication using Redis sets with TTL to prevent duplicate messages, add batch processing for multiple file events within debounce window using tokio streams, implement queue partition strategy based on chat_id for improved parallelism using tokio task distribution, create queue monitoring alerts using configured alerting system, and optimize queue worker scaling based on queue depth and processing metrics with proper Rust error handling using Result types.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite using Rust testing framework with #[tokio::test]: Queue system testing using redis-test or embedded-redis to validate queue activation, job processing, priority handling, and failure scenarios including dead letter queue processing. File debouncing testing using tokio::fs and mock file system events to verify 500ms debounce window accuracy with notify crate integration, file change detection using sha2 hashing, and batch processing efficiency. Integration testing combining file events with queue processing to measure end-to-end delivery improvement from current baseline to 98%+ target using tokio async/await patterns. Performance testing using custom Rust load testing tools to simulate high-volume file events and measure queue throughput, processing latency, and memory usage under load. Create specific test scenarios for: queue worker scaling under load using tokio task management, Redis connection failure and recovery with redis-rs, file event deduplication using sha2 content hashing, and batch processing optimization with tokio channels. Implement monitoring validation tests using custom metrics collection to verify queue health monitoring and alerting functionality.
