# Task ID: 25
# Title: Comprehensive Test Coverage Improvements and Advanced Testing Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14, 16, 17, 20, 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance testing infrastructure with comprehensive integration tests for the 3-tier cascading system, end-to-end workflow testing, performance benchmarking, and chaos engineering tests to achieve enterprise-grade testing coverage.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive integration tests for the 3-tier cascading monitoring system using Jest and supertest, validating webhook response times (0-100ms), bridge processing (100-500ms), and file watcher fallbacks (1-5s) with real-time latency measurements. Create end-to-end workflow tests using Playwright to simulate complete user journeys from Telegram message receipt through Claude Code notifications, including error scenarios and recovery paths. Implement performance test suite using k6 and autocannon for load testing all components with configurable concurrency levels (10-1000 concurrent users), measuring response times, throughput, and resource utilization. Set up chaos engineering tests using chaos-monkey-lambda and toxiproxy to simulate network failures, service outages, and resource constraints, validating system resilience and automatic recovery mechanisms. Create comprehensive test data factories using factory-bot pattern for consistent test scenarios across integration and E2E tests. Implement test coverage reporting with nyc/istanbul targeting 95% code coverage for critical paths. Set up performance regression testing with baseline comparisons and automated alerts for performance degradation >10%. Create visual regression testing using percy.io or similar for UI components. Implement contract testing using Pact for API validation between MCP server and bridge components. Add mutation testing using Stryker.js to validate test quality and effectiveness.

# Test Strategy:
Execute integration test suite with Docker Compose environment simulating production conditions, including Redis, file system, and mock Telegram API. Run E2E tests in headless browser environments across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari using Playwright test runner with parallel execution. Perform load testing scenarios: baseline (10 concurrent users), stress (100 users), spike (1000 users), and endurance (sustained load for 30 minutes). Execute chaos engineering tests with controlled failure injection: network partitions, service crashes, resource exhaustion, and dependency failures. Validate test coverage meets 95% threshold for critical components using automated coverage gates in CI/CD pipeline. Implement performance benchmarking with automated regression detection comparing against baseline metrics. Create test reporting dashboard using Allure or similar for comprehensive test result visualization and historical tracking.
