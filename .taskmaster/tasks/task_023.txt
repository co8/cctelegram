# Task ID: 23
# Title: Address Critical Security Vulnerabilities in npm Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve 20 known npm security vulnerabilities including 2 critical and 5 high priority by updating form-data, d3-color, tough-cookie, got packages and implementing comprehensive security headers.
# Details:
Use npm audit to identify and analyze all 20 vulnerabilities with CVSS scoring and impact assessment. Update vulnerable packages: form-data to latest stable version (^4.0.0) to fix potential RCE vulnerabilities, d3-color to ^3.1.0 to address prototype pollution, tough-cookie to ^4.1.0 for cookie parsing security, and got to ^13.0.0 for HTTP request security. Implement automated vulnerability scanning using Snyk CLI integration in CI/CD pipeline. Configure security headers using helmet.js middleware: Content-Security-Policy with strict-dynamic and nonce-based CSP, X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, Strict-Transport-Security with max-age=31536000, Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin. Implement dependency pinning in package-lock.json with exact versions for critical security packages. Use npm-check-updates for safe version updates and semantic versioning validation. Configure Dependabot with security-only updates and automatic PR creation. Implement package integrity validation using npm ci --audit and subresource integrity checks. Create security.md documentation with vulnerability disclosure process and security contact information. Use ossf/scorecard for supply chain security assessment and SLSA provenance verification.

# Test Strategy:
Execute npm audit --audit-level=moderate to verify zero vulnerabilities above moderate severity. Run Snyk test command to validate all critical and high vulnerabilities are resolved. Implement security header validation using SecurityHeaders.com API or custom tests with supertest. Create automated security regression tests using OWASP ZAP baseline security scan. Validate package updates with integration test suite ensuring no breaking changes. Test CSP implementation with Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only header first, then enforce. Use npm ls --audit to verify dependency tree integrity. Implement automated vulnerability monitoring with GitHub Security Advisories and npm audit in CI/CD pipeline with failure thresholds.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit and Categorize All npm Security Vulnerabilities [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run comprehensive vulnerability scanning to identify and analyze all 20 security vulnerabilities with CVSS scoring and impact assessment
### Details:
Execute npm audit --audit-level=info --json to generate detailed vulnerability report. Use npm audit --audit-level=critical and --audit-level=high to specifically identify the 2 critical and 5 high priority vulnerabilities. Document each vulnerability with CVSS score, affected package versions, exploit potential, and remediation requirements. Cross-reference findings with Snyk database for additional context and validate that form-data, d3-color, tough-cookie, and got packages are among the vulnerable dependencies.

## 2. Update Vulnerable npm Packages to Secure Versions [done]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Update form-data, d3-color, tough-cookie, and got packages to their latest secure versions to resolve critical vulnerabilities
### Details:
Update form-data to ^4.0.0 to fix potential RCE vulnerabilities. Update d3-color to ^3.1.0 to address prototype pollution issues. Update tough-cookie to ^4.1.0 for cookie parsing security fixes. Update got to ^13.0.0 for HTTP request security improvements. Use npm-check-updates to validate semantic versioning compatibility and identify any breaking changes. Update package.json with new versions and run npm install to update package-lock.json with exact dependency versions.

## 3. Implement Comprehensive Security Headers with Helmet.js [done]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Configure and implement security headers middleware using helmet.js to protect against common web vulnerabilities
### Details:
Install helmet.js middleware and configure comprehensive security headers: Content-Security-Policy with strict-dynamic and nonce-based CSP for script execution, X-Frame-Options set to DENY to prevent clickjacking, X-Content-Type-Options set to nosniff to prevent MIME sniffing attacks, Strict-Transport-Security with max-age=31536000 to enforce HTTPS, and Referrer-Policy set to strict-origin-when-cross-origin for privacy protection. Implement proper CSP nonce generation and integration with existing middleware stack.

## 4. Set Up Automated Vulnerability Scanning and CI/CD Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Implement automated vulnerability scanning using Snyk CLI and configure Dependabot for continuous security monitoring
### Details:
Install and configure Snyk CLI for automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline. Set up GitHub Actions or equivalent CI workflow to run npm audit and snyk test on every pull request and deployment. Configure Dependabot with security-only updates and automatic PR creation for vulnerability fixes. Implement package integrity validation using npm ci --audit and configure subresource integrity checks for CDN resources. Set up automated notifications for new vulnerabilities and failed security scans.

## 5. Create Security Documentation and Supply Chain Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Establish security documentation, vulnerability disclosure process, and implement supply chain security assessment
### Details:
Create comprehensive security.md documentation including vulnerability disclosure process, security contact information, and security update procedures. Implement ossf/scorecard for supply chain security assessment and SLSA provenance verification. Document security header configurations and their purposes. Create runbook for handling future security vulnerabilities including escalation procedures and communication protocols. Set up regular security review schedule and document security best practices for the development team.
