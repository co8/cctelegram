# Task ID: 19
# Title: CI/CD Pipeline and Automated Quality Gates
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, security scanning, and deployment automation
# Details:
Create GitHub Actions workflows with matrix testing across Node.js 18/20 LTS versions and multiple OS (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows). Implement automated security scanning using Snyk, SAST with CodeQL, and container scanning with Trivy. Set up semantic versioning with semantic-release and automated changelog generation. Implement blue-green deployment strategy with health checks and rollback capabilities. Create staging environment with production-like data for integration testing. Use Dependabot for automated dependency updates with security vulnerability alerts. Implement code quality gates with SonarQube integration.

# Test Strategy:
Pipeline testing with different deployment scenarios. Integration testing in staging environment with production data simulation. Automated rollback testing to validate recovery procedures. Performance regression testing in CI/CD with baseline comparisons and automated alerts.
