AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION SECURITY REVIEW COMPLETE - Comprehensive security review reveals CRITICAL authentication architecture flaws requiring immediate remediation. While input validation and path sanitization are excellent, the core authentication and authorization mechanisms have fundamental design issues that expose the system to privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

CRITICAL SECURITY FINDINGS:
- CRITICAL: Broken Authentication Architecture (CVSS 9.1) - Static API Key Usage with single MCP_DEFAULT_API_KEY for ALL requests, no per-request authentication, rate limiting bypass via withSecurity() without context, universal permissions for all users
- HIGH: Authorization Bypass Mechanisms (CVSS 8.2) - Authentication disable bypass when MCP_ENABLE_AUTH=false, no RBAC implementation, no granular permissions, missing authorization validation
- HIGH: Secret Management Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.8) - Plaintext TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN storage, secret exposure in logs, no rotation mechanisms, environment variable leakage
- MEDIUM: Session Management Deficiencies (CVSS 5.4) - No session tracking, expiration, or invalidation capabilities
- MEDIUM: File System Access Control Gaps (CVSS 4.7) - OS-level only protection with no application-level controls

OWASP ASVS Level 2 Compliance: NON-COMPLIANT - Fails authentication, access control, and business logic requirements.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
P0: Fix withSecurity context passing and implement per-request authentication
P1: Implement RBAC and secure secret management
P2: Add session management with expiration
Overall Assessment: REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION before production deployment.

**SECURITY AUDIT COMPLETE - NETWORK SECURITY ANALYSIS FINDINGS:**

Network security assessment completed with mixed results. Rate limiting implementation is excellent using rate-limiter-flexible library (100 requests/60 seconds) with proper configuration via environment variables MCP_RATE_LIMIT_POINTS and MCP_RATE_LIMIT_DURATION. Memory-based rate limiting includes proper error handling and bypass detection for missing clientId context.

Critical security gaps identified in HTTP communications: health endpoint (localhost:8080/health) and metrics endpoint (localhost:8080/metrics) operate without TLS encryption. Axios client configured with 5000ms timeout for health checks. Bridge status caching implemented (30 second duration) to reduce health check load.

**SECURITY VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED:**
- HIGH RISK: Missing TLS encryption for internal communications (CVSS 7.4) - all internal traffic transmitted unencrypted
- MEDIUM RISK: Absent HTTP security headers (CVSS 5.3) - missing HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options defense-in-depth protections  
- LOW RISK: Network DoS vulnerabilities (CVSS 3.1) - basic rate limiting provides minimal protection

**POSITIVE SECURITY CONTROLS:**
- Localhost-only binding provides good network isolation
- Configurable health port via CC_TELEGRAM_HEALTH_PORT environment variable
- Request timeouts prevent hanging connections
- Rate limiting prevents basic abuse scenarios

**PRIORITY REMEDIATION REQUIRED:**
P1: Implement HTTPS/TLS for all internal communications
P2: Add comprehensive HTTP security headers for web interfaces
P3: Implement network-level monitoring and alerting systems
P4: Add connection rate limiting and request size limits

Network attack surface analysis complete. Security documentation and CVSS scoring report ready for compilation.
