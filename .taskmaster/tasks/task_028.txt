# Task ID: 28
# Title: System Performance Optimization and Resource Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15, 17, 20
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement comprehensive performance optimizations focusing on memory usage, response times, resource leak prevention, async file operations, and automated cleanup mechanisms to enhance system efficiency and reliability.
# Details:
Implement memory optimization using Node.js heap profiling with clinic.js and 0x profiler to identify memory leaks and optimize garbage collection patterns. Replace all synchronous file operations (fs.readFileSync, fs.writeFileSync) with async alternatives (fs.promises.readFile, fs.promises.writeFile) and implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks. Create memory cleanup mechanisms using WeakMap for automatic garbage collection of unused references and implement periodic cleanup intervals using setInterval with clearInterval cleanup. Optimize response times by implementing HTTP connection pooling using undici or node-fetch with keepAlive, request/response caching using node-cache with TTL policies, and database query optimization with connection pooling. Implement resource leak detection using process.memoryUsage() monitoring and automatic alerts when memory usage exceeds thresholds. Create performance monitoring dashboard using prom-client for Prometheus metrics collection with memory usage, response times, and request throughput tracking. Implement async/await patterns for all I/O operations replacing callback-based approaches, use stream processing for large file operations to reduce memory footprint, and implement backpressure handling for high-throughput scenarios. Add automated performance regression testing using clinic.js flame graphs and benchmarking with autocannon for load testing. Create resource cleanup utilities using process.on('exit') and process.on('SIGTERM') handlers for graceful shutdown with proper resource deallocation.

# Test Strategy:
Implement performance test suite using k6 for load testing with memory usage monitoring during sustained traffic to validate memory leak fixes and response time improvements. Create memory profiling tests using clinic.js doctor to analyze event loop delay and memory growth patterns before and after optimizations. Test async file operations with large file processing scenarios using temporary test files and validate proper error handling and memory cleanup. Implement automated performance regression tests using GitHub Actions with baseline performance metrics comparison and failure thresholds for response times and memory usage. Create chaos engineering tests simulating high memory pressure and resource exhaustion scenarios to validate cleanup mechanisms and graceful degradation. Use Artillery or autocannon for sustained load testing with real-time monitoring of system resources and automated alerts when performance degrades beyond acceptable thresholds.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Memory Profiling and Leak Detection Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive memory profiling tools and implement monitoring for memory leaks and garbage collection patterns
### Details:
Install and configure clinic.js and 0x profiler for Node.js heap profiling. Implement process.memoryUsage() monitoring with automated alerts when memory usage exceeds defined thresholds (e.g., 80% of available heap). Create memory leak detection mechanisms using WeakMap for automatic garbage collection of unused references. Set up periodic memory monitoring intervals using setInterval with proper clearInterval cleanup on shutdown.

## 2. Async File Operations Migration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace all synchronous file operations with async alternatives and implement proper error handling
### Details:
Audit codebase to identify all synchronous file operations (fs.readFileSync, fs.writeFileSync, fs.existsSync). Replace with async alternatives using fs.promises (readFile, writeFile, access) and implement comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks. Update all calling code to use async/await patterns. Implement stream processing for large file operations to reduce memory footprint and add backpressure handling.

## 3. HTTP Connection Pooling and Caching [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement HTTP connection pooling and request/response caching for improved response times
### Details:
Implement HTTP connection pooling using undici or node-fetch with keepAlive configuration. Set up request/response caching using node-cache with TTL policies for frequently accessed data. Configure connection pool sizes based on expected load patterns. Implement cache invalidation strategies for dynamic data and cache warming for critical endpoints.

## 4. Database Query Optimization and Connection Pooling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize database operations with connection pooling and query performance improvements
### Details:
Implement database connection pooling with configurable pool sizes and connection lifecycle management. Analyze and optimize slow queries using database profiling tools. Implement query result caching for frequently accessed data. Add query timeout handling and connection retry logic with exponential backoff.

## 5. Performance Monitoring Dashboard [done]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Create comprehensive performance monitoring dashboard with Prometheus metrics collection
### Details:
Implement performance monitoring using prom-client for Prometheus metrics collection. Track key metrics: memory usage, response times, request throughput, error rates, and garbage collection statistics. Create custom metrics for business-specific performance indicators. Set up metric scraping endpoints and configure retention policies.

## 6. Resource Cleanup and Graceful Shutdown [done]
### Dependencies: 28.2, 28.3, 28.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive resource cleanup utilities and graceful shutdown mechanisms
### Details:
Create resource cleanup utilities using process.on('exit') and process.on('SIGTERM') handlers for graceful shutdown. Implement proper resource deallocation for file handles, database connections, HTTP connections, and timer cleanup. Add timeout mechanisms for shutdown processes to prevent hanging. Create resource tracking to ensure all resources are properly cleaned up.

## 7. Performance Regression Testing and Benchmarking [done]
### Dependencies: 28.1, 28.3, 28.5
### Description: Implement automated performance regression testing with comprehensive benchmarking suite
### Details:
Set up automated performance regression testing using clinic.js flame graphs for CPU profiling analysis.
