# Task ID: 32
# Title: Phase 4: Error Handling & UX - Improve MCP Connectivity Error Messages and User Experience
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17, 26, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling improvements for MCP connectivity issues including user-friendly status indicators, retry mechanisms for transient failures, and actionable guidance to enhance user experience during connection problems.
# Details:
Implement enhanced error handling and UX improvements for MCP connectivity: 1) Error Message Enhancement - Create user-friendly error message system using chalk for colored console output, implement error categorization (connection timeout, authentication failure, server unavailable, network error) with specific error codes and descriptions, create contextual help system that provides actionable solutions for each error type, and implement progressive error disclosure showing basic message first with option to view technical details. 2) Status Indicators - Implement real-time connection status indicators using ora spinner library for connection attempts, create persistent status bar showing MCP server health (connected, connecting, disconnected, error), implement connection quality indicators (latency, success rate, last successful communication), and add visual feedback using symbols (‚úÖ connected, ‚ö†Ô∏è degraded, ‚ùå disconnected, üîÑ connecting). 3) Retry Mechanisms - Implement intelligent retry logic using p-retry with exponential backoff and jitter, create connection health monitoring with circuit breaker pattern using opossum to prevent cascading failures, implement automatic reconnection with progressive backoff intervals (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s), and add manual retry options with clear feedback on retry attempts. 4) Actionable Guidance - Create comprehensive troubleshooting system with diagnostic commands (/diagnose-mcp), implement guided repair workflows for common issues (port conflicts, permission errors, configuration problems), create interactive problem solver that walks users through resolution steps, and implement help system with context-aware suggestions based on current error state. 5) Integration with Configuration Management - Leverage Task 26's configuration validation to check MCP server settings, implement configuration repair suggestions when connection fails due to misconfiguration, create backup configuration options for MCP server settings, and add configuration health checks during startup.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite using Jest with mock MCP server scenarios including connection timeouts, server unavailability, and authentication failures to validate error message clarity and actionable guidance effectiveness. Implement user experience testing using inquirer.js prompts to simulate interactive error resolution workflows and measure user success rates in resolving common MCP connectivity issues. Test retry mechanism effectiveness using controlled network conditions with proxy tools to simulate intermittent connectivity, connection drops, and varying latency conditions. Create visual regression tests using jest-image-snapshot for status indicator displays and error message formatting consistency. Implement load testing for retry mechanisms to ensure they don't overwhelm servers during outages. Test integration with configuration management system by introducing various configuration errors and validating repair suggestions accuracy. Create end-to-end user journey tests that simulate realistic error scenarios and measure time-to-resolution for different error types.
