# Task ID: 21
# Title: 3-Tier Cascading Response Monitoring System Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a comprehensive real-time response monitoring system with three cascading fallback layers: MCP Real-Time Webhook (0-100ms), Bridge Internal Processing (100-500ms), and File Watcher System (1-5s) to ensure 100% response reliability.
# Details:
Implement Tier 1 MCP Real-Time Webhook System using Node.js HTTP server with Express.js for instant Bridge notifications within 0-100ms response time. Create webhook endpoint '/webhook/bridge-response' with JSON payload validation using joi schema. Implement immediate response processing with async/await pattern and acknowledgment system using UUID correlation IDs. Integrate with existing MCP server architecture using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for real-time Claude Code session notifications. Implement Tier 2 Bridge Internal Processing as fallback layer using Rust actix-web framework for 100-500ms response handling. Create direct Telegram acknowledgments using teloxide crate with automatic retry mechanism and exponential backoff (initial: 100ms, max: 2s). Implement self-contained response handling with tokio async runtime for concurrent processing. Add circuit breaker pattern using failsafe crate to detect webhook failures and trigger fallback. Implement Tier 3 File Watcher System using notify crate in Rust for 1-5 seconds guaranteed response processing. Create debounced file operations using tokio::time::sleep with 500ms debounce window to prevent duplicate processing. Implement file-based response queue with JSON serialization and atomic file operations using tempfile crate. Add comprehensive logging using tracing crate with structured logs including correlation IDs, processing tier, response times, and failure reasons. Implement configurable timeout mechanisms: webhook timeout (100ms), bridge processing timeout (500ms), file watcher debounce (500ms), and overall system timeout (10s). Create monitoring dashboard integration with Prometheus metrics for tier-specific success rates, response times, and failover events. Implement health check endpoints for each tier with detailed status reporting. Add graceful degradation with automatic tier selection based on availability and performance metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite using Jest for MCP webhook testing with supertest for HTTP endpoint validation and mock Telegram Bot API responses. Implement Rust unit tests using tokio-test for async processing validation and integration tests with actual file system operations. Test cascading fallback behavior by systematically disabling each tier and verifying automatic failover to next available tier. Implement load testing using k6 to validate response time requirements: Tier 1 < 100ms, Tier 2 < 500ms, Tier 3 < 5s under concurrent load of 100 requests/second. Create chaos engineering tests using toxiproxy to simulate network failures, database unavailability, and partial system outages. Test response reliability with 10,000 consecutive requests ensuring 100% processing success across all failure scenarios. Implement monitoring validation by creating synthetic test responses and verifying metrics collection, alerting triggers, and dashboard updates. Test configuration changes and system reconfiguration without service interruption. Validate audit trail completeness by tracking correlation IDs through all three tiers and ensuring complete logging coverage.
