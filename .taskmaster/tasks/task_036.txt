# Task ID: 36
# Title: Phase 3: Architecture Improvements - Enhanced Tier Orchestrator with Monitoring and Error Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 35, 34, 20, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the existing 3-tier architecture orchestrator with advanced error classification, comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus metrics, and enhanced resilience features to achieve 99%+ message delivery rate.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive architecture improvements building on existing 3-tier message delivery system: 1) Tier Orchestrator Enhancement - Extend current orchestrator with intelligent tier selection algorithm based on message priority, recipient availability, and historical success rates, implement dynamic load balancing across tiers with circuit breaker pattern per tier, add tier health monitoring with automatic failover to backup tiers, and create tier performance analytics with response time tracking and throughput optimization. 2) Advanced Error Classification System - Implement comprehensive error taxonomy extending existing error handling with categories: transient errors (network timeouts, rate limits, temporary API failures), permanent errors (authentication failures, invalid recipients, blocked users), and critical errors (system failures, data corruption, security violations), create error severity scoring system (1-10 scale) with automatic escalation rules, implement error correlation engine to identify patterns and root causes, and add error recovery strategies with automatic retry policies per error category. 3) Production-Grade Monitoring with Prometheus - Deploy Prometheus metrics collection with custom collectors for message delivery metrics (success rate, latency percentiles, error rates by type), implement Grafana dashboards with SLA/SLO tracking (99% delivery rate target, <500ms P95 latency, <0.1% error rate), create alerting rules using AlertManager for threshold breaches with PagerDuty integration, add business metrics tracking (messages per hour, user engagement rates, system utilization), and implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry for end-to-end request tracking. 4) Resilience Engineering Features - Implement bulkhead pattern to isolate different message types, add timeout management with adaptive timeouts based on historical performance, create message priority queuing with weighted fair queuing algorithm, implement graceful degradation with reduced functionality modes during high load, and add automated recovery procedures with health check endpoints and self-healing capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive validation framework for architecture improvements: Tier orchestrator testing using Jest with mock Telegram API to simulate tier failures and validate automatic failover mechanisms, load testing with k6 to verify 99% delivery rate under various load conditions (1K, 10K, 50K messages/hour), error classification testing using fault injection to validate proper categorization and recovery strategies across all error types. Prometheus monitoring validation using testcontainers to spin up Prometheus/Grafana stack and verify metric collection accuracy, alerting simulation tests to validate threshold detection and notification delivery, performance regression testing to ensure monitoring overhead stays below 2% of system resources. Resilience testing using chaos engineering principles with Chaos Monkey to simulate network partitions, service failures, and resource exhaustion scenarios, validate graceful degradation maintains core functionality, and verify automated recovery procedures restore full service within SLA targets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Tier Orchestrator Enhancement with Intelligent Selection [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend the existing orchestrator with intelligent tier selection algorithm based on message priority, recipient availability, and historical success rates. Implement dynamic load balancing and circuit breaker pattern per tier.
### Details:
Implement intelligent tier selection algorithm using weighted scoring based on message priority (high/medium/low), recipient availability status, and historical success rates from performance analytics. Add dynamic load balancing across tiers using round-robin with health-based weighting. Implement circuit breaker pattern per tier with configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts. Create tier health monitoring with automatic failover to backup tiers. Integrate with existing 3-tier architecture without breaking current functionality.

## 2. Advanced Error Classification and Recovery System [done]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive error taxonomy with automatic classification, severity scoring, and intelligent recovery strategies for different error types.
### Details:
Create comprehensive error taxonomy with three main categories: transient errors (network timeouts, rate limits, temporary API failures), permanent errors (authentication failures, invalid recipients, blocked users), and critical errors (system failures, data corruption, security violations). Implement error severity scoring system (1-10 scale) with automatic escalation rules. Build error correlation engine to identify patterns and root causes using historical error data. Add error recovery strategies with automatic retry policies per error category, including exponential backoff for transient errors and immediate alerting for critical errors.

## 3. Production-Grade Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana [done]
### Dependencies: 36.1, 36.2
### Description: Deploy comprehensive monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards, and AlertManager integration for SLA tracking and alerting.
### Details:
Deploy Prometheus metrics collection with custom collectors for message delivery metrics including success rate, latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99), error rates by type and tier. Implement Grafana dashboards with SLA/SLO tracking targeting 99% delivery rate, <500ms P95 latency, and <0.1% error rate. Create alerting rules using AlertManager for threshold breaches with PagerDuty integration for critical alerts. Add business metrics tracking including messages per hour, user engagement rates, and system utilization. Implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry for end-to-end request tracking across all tiers.

## 4. Resilience Engineering and Self-Healing Capabilities [done]
### Dependencies: 36.2, 36.3
### Description: Implement advanced resilience patterns including bulkhead isolation, adaptive timeouts, priority queuing, and automated recovery procedures.
### Details:
Implement bulkhead pattern to isolate different message types (notifications, alerts, system messages) preventing cascading failures. Add timeout management with adaptive timeouts based on historical performance data and current system load. Create message priority queuing with weighted fair queuing algorithm ensuring high-priority messages are processed first. Implement graceful degradation with reduced functionality modes during high load or partial system failures. Add automated recovery procedures with comprehensive health check endpoints and self-healing capabilities including automatic service restarts and resource cleanup.
