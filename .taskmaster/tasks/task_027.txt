# Task ID: 27
# Title: Complete Documentation Updates and Improvements
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 20, 22, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Comprehensive documentation overhaul including API documentation, deployment guides, troubleshooting resources, and updated architecture diagrams reflecting the current 3-tier cascading system design.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive documentation using GitBook or VitePress with automated generation from TypeScript interfaces and JSDoc comments. Create API documentation using OpenAPI 3.0 specification with Swagger UI integration, documenting all 16 MCP tools, webhook endpoints, and bridge communication protocols. Generate TypeScript API documentation using TypeDoc with custom themes and cross-reference linking. Develop deployment guides covering Docker containerization, Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts, CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions, environment configuration for development/staging/production, and SSL certificate management. Create troubleshooting documentation with categorized error codes, diagnostic commands, log analysis guides, and recovery procedures for the 3-tier system (webhook→bridge→file watcher). Update architecture diagrams using Mermaid.js or PlantUML embedded in documentation, showing current system design including MCP server architecture, 3-tier cascading monitoring system, Telegram bot integration, Claude Code notification flow, security layers, and data flow patterns. Implement documentation versioning aligned with semantic release strategy, automated link checking using linkinator, and documentation testing using markdown-link-check. Create interactive examples using CodeSandbox embeds for MCP tool usage and configuration scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Validate API documentation accuracy by running automated tests against actual endpoints using Postman collections exported from OpenAPI specs. Test deployment guides by executing them in clean environments using Docker containers and verifying successful system deployment. Validate troubleshooting procedures by introducing controlled failures and confirming resolution steps work correctly. Test architecture diagrams by reviewing with system architects and validating against actual codebase structure. Implement documentation CI/CD pipeline with automated spell checking using cspell, markdown linting using markdownlint, and broken link detection. Create user acceptance testing scenarios where team members follow documentation to complete common tasks without additional guidance.
