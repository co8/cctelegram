# Claude Code Telegram Bridge - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Claude Code Telegram Bridge is a lightweight Rust application that enables remote monitoring and interaction with Claude Code and VSCode workflows via Telegram. This solution allows developers to stay connected to their development processes when away from their computers, receiving notifications about task completions and responding to approval requests through a mobile-friendly Telegram interface.

## Problem Statement

Developers using Claude Code and VSCode often initiate long-running tasks (code analysis, builds, refactoring) and need to step away from their computers. Currently, there's no way to:
- Receive notifications when tasks complete
- Respond to approval requests remotely  
- Monitor progress of ongoing operations
- Stay connected to development workflows while mobile

## Solution Overview

A Rust-based bridge application that:
1. Monitors Claude Code and VSCode activities through file-based event system
2. Sends formatted notifications to Telegram with interactive buttons
3. Processes user responses and communicates decisions back to tools
4. Provides secure, authenticated remote access to development workflows

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Individual developers using Claude Code for complex, time-consuming tasks

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### Bridge Application (Rust)
- **File Watcher**: Monitor ~/.cc_telegram/events/ for new events
- **Event Processor**: Parse JSON events, validate, and route
- **Telegram Client**: Bot API integration with rate limiting
- **Response Handler**: Process user responses, write to responses directory
- **Configuration Manager**: Secure settings and authentication

#### Communication Protocol
- **Event Format**: JSON files with standardized schema
- **Event Types**: task_completion, approval_request, progress_update
- **Response Format**: JSON responses with user decisions
- **Security**: File permissions, user validation, audit logging

#### Integration Points
- **Claude Code**: Minimal hook system writing event files
- **VSCode**: Extension monitoring workspace events
- **Telegram**: Bot API for bidirectional communication
- **File System**: Secure event/response file exchange

### Data Flow
1. Claude Code/VSCode writes event to ~/.cc_telegram/events/
2. Bridge app detects new file, parses JSON event
3. Formats and sends Telegram message with interactive buttons
4. User responds via Telegram, bridge processes response
5. Bridge writes response to ~/.cc_telegram/responses/
6. Claude Code/VSCode monitors responses, continues workflow

## Technology Stack

- **Core Application**: Rust (performance, memory safety, single binary)
- **Telegram Integration**: teloxide crate (Telegram bot framework)
- **File Monitoring**: notify crate (cross-platform file watching)
- **Configuration**: config crate, TOML format
- **Logging**: tracing crate with structured output
- **Serialization**: serde with JSON support

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
