			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Security Audit and Vulnerability Assessment",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the security audit into specialized areas: dependency scanning with npm audit/Snyk, static code analysis with semgrep, STRIDE threat modeling, authentication/authorization review, input validation assessment, access control audit, security headers implementation, and comprehensive security documentation with CVSS scoring.",
			"reasoning": "Extremely complex task requiring deep security expertise across multiple domains. Security audits involve specialized tools, methodologies like STRIDE, and comprehensive analysis of 32 dependencies. The OWASP ASVS Level 2 compliance adds significant complexity requiring detailed knowledge of security standards."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the testing implementation into layers: Jest framework setup and configuration, unit test suite creation for all 16 MCP tools, integration testing with supertest and API mocking, E2E testing with Playwright, code coverage setup with nyc/istanbul, test fixtures and factories implementation, and CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multi-layered testing approach covering unit, integration, and E2E tests. Requires expertise in multiple testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright, supertest) and achieving 90% code coverage across 16 MCP tools adds significant scope and technical challenge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Benchmarking System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize performance work into specialized areas: profiling setup with clinic.js and 0x, benchmarking suite with benchmark.js, memory leak detection and heap analysis, file system optimization and connection pooling, performance budgets implementation and monitoring, and APM integration with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity requiring specialized Node.js performance knowledge. Performance optimization involves multiple tools (clinic.js, 0x, benchmark.js) and requires understanding of memory management, async operations, and distributed tracing. Setting measurable performance budgets adds analytical complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "MCP Tools Integration Testing and Validation Framework",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure MCP testing into specialized components: MCP protocol implementation with @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, mock MCP client creation, comprehensive tool testing matrix for all 16 tools, schema validation with zod, Telegram Bot API integration testing, and WebSocket real-time communication testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to MCP protocol specificity and need to test 16 different tools comprehensively. Requires deep understanding of MCP SDK, WebSocket communication, and Telegram Bot API integration. Schema validation and mock client creation add technical sophistication."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Advanced Error Handling and Resilience Engineering",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break resilience engineering into core patterns: circuit breaker implementation with opossum, comprehensive error taxonomy and custom error classes, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and jitter, structured logging with winston and correlation IDs, graceful shutdown and resource cleanup, and health check endpoints with monitoring integration.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity requiring deep understanding of resilience patterns and distributed systems concepts. Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and graceful shutdown handling require sophisticated error handling knowledge. Integration with monitoring systems adds operational complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Enterprise Documentation and API Specification",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize documentation into enterprise deliverables: OpenAPI 3.1 specification generation, comprehensive README and usage guides, TSDoc/JSDoc implementation with automated generation, deployment guides for multiple environments, and operational procedures including security and incident response documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on comprehensive documentation creation. While not technically complex in implementation, requires thorough understanding of all system components to document effectively. OpenAPI specification generation and multiple deployment environment documentation add scope complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "CI/CD Pipeline and Automated Quality Gates",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure CI/CD implementation into pipeline components: GitHub Actions workflow creation with matrix testing, security scanning integration (Snyk, CodeQL, Trivy), semantic versioning and automated releases, blue-green deployment with health checks, staging environment setup, dependency management with Dependabot, and code quality gates with SonarQube.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring DevOps expertise across multiple platforms and tools. Matrix testing across Node.js versions and OS, multiple security scanning tools, and blue-green deployment strategies require sophisticated pipeline orchestration. Integration with quality gates adds operational complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Production Monitoring and Observability Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement observability stack in specialized areas: OpenTelemetry and Jaeger distributed tracing setup, Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboard creation, log aggregation with ELK/Loki stack, alerting and escalation with PagerDuty integration, APM integration with performance monitoring, and Kubernetes Helm chart deployment with monitoring integration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring expertise in multiple observability tools and platforms. OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack integration requires deep understanding of monitoring architectures. SLA/SLO tracking and Kubernetes deployment add enterprise-level operational complexity."
