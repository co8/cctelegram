## Configuration

### Coverage Configuration (.nycrc.json)

```json
{
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["src/**/*.test.ts", "src/**/*.spec.ts"],
  "reporter": ["text", "lcov", "html", "json"],
  "lines": 95,
  "functions": 95,
  "branches": 90,
  "statements": 95,
  "check-coverage": true,
  "per-file": true
}
```

### Mutation Testing Configuration (stryker.conf.json)

```json
{
  "testRunner": "jest",
  "mutate": ["src/**/*.ts", "!src/**/*.test.ts"],
  "thresholds": {
    "high": 90,
    "low": 70,
    "break": 60
  },

```

### Jest Integration

Coverage is integrated into Jest configuration with enhanced thresholds:

```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 90,
    functions: 95,
    lines: 95,
    statements: 95
  },
  './src/security.ts': {
    branches: 95,

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Coverage Too Low

1. **Identify Gaps** - Check HTML report for uncovered lines
2. **Add Tests** - Write tests for uncovered code
3. **Check Exclusions** - Verify exclude patterns
4. **Review Thresholds** - Adjust if unrealistic

#### Mutation Score Low

1. **Analyze Survivors** - Check which mutants survived
2. **Improve Tests** - Add edge case testing
3. **Check Test Quality** - Ensure comprehensive assertions
4. **Review Mutant Types** - Focus on high-impact mutations

#### CI Failures

1. **Check Logs** - Review GitHub Actions logs
2. **Local Testing** - Run quality gates locally
3. **Environment Issues** - Verify CI environment setup
4. **Threshold Adjustment** - Consider temporary threshold reduction

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Coverage Analysis

- Use `--maxWorkers=50%` for Jest
- Enable nyc caching
- Exclude unnecessary files
- Use incremental mode for Stryker

#### Memory Issues

- Increase Node.js memory: `--max-old-space-size=4096`
- Use streaming reporters
- Reduce parallel workers
- Clean up temporary files

## 📚 Best Practices

### Writing Testable Code

1. **Small Functions** - Easier to test comprehensively
2. **Pure Functions** - Predictable input/output
3. **Dependency Injection** - Mockable dependencies
4. **Error Handling** - Test all error paths

### Effective Testing

1. **Edge Cases** - Test boundary conditions
2. **Error Scenarios** - Test failure paths
3. **Integration Points** - Test component interactions
4. **Performance** - Test under load

### Coverage Optimization

1. **Focus on Critical Paths** - Prioritize high-risk code
2. **Exclude Generated Code** - Don't test auto-generated files
3. **Test Utilities** - Include test helper coverage
4. **Review Regularly** - Monitor trends weekly

### Mutation Testing Strategy

1. **Start Small** - Begin with critical modules
2. **Iterative Improvement** - Gradual mutation score increase
3. **Focus on Survivors** - Prioritize surviving mutants
4. **Balance Performance** - Optimize for CI time limits
